 As part of cohesion policy, the reforms are very important and are aimed at alleviating the adverse effects caused by the financial crisis. The flexibility allowed in distributing Community funds will provide national economies with immediate cash flow, which will enable them to invest in the real economy. This will have an immediate effect and we will definitely see the initial results in the following months.
 The European Commission is supporting Member States’ economies based on four major priorities, the most important of these being increasing the pre-financing from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund and increasing the support from the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund. In fact, in 2009 the pre-financing which the new Member States in particular receive may help to overcome the crisis, as well as establish social and territorial cohesion.
 Great importance must also be attached to the report on the eligibility of investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing. The renovation of residential heating systems must feature on the European Union’s agenda of priorities, bearing in mind the added value generated by this measure.
 At a time when heating costs are constantly on the rise, Member States must also include in their programmes to combat the financial crisis projects which take into account energy efficiency. They offer the following important benefits to the economy and population: a cash flow injection into the economy, along with job creation, a reduction in heating costs, protection of the environment through cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the provision of social cohesion and support for low-income families.

Furthermore, inept handling of these issues by the respective governments and the EU itself has seriously undermined public confidence in the ability of politicians to deal with crises in the food chain.
 For these reasons, I welcome both Commissioner Byrne’s commitment to make food safety his number one priority and also the statement by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, in this House on 23 July, when he said that one of the first tasks of his Commission would be to restore consumer confidence in the safety of food products. Hence this debate. Commissioner Byrne, I may add, is to be commended for his prompt action in agreeing to produce a White Paper on EU food law later this year and also to tighten up the EU’s rapid alert system for food emergencies.
 However, I would urge the Commissioner to go the extra mile: if he and his colleagues are determined to regain the confidence of consumers and the food industry in the EU’s food safety structures, then he should establish a European food agency along similar lines to the US Food and Drug Administration. Such a body could take responsibility for the Commission’s present inspection and enforcement functions in relation to the food hygiene, veterinary and plant health legislation. It could also have responsibility for the rapid alert system itself. It could be given the role for the authorisation process for GMOs and genetically modified foods while also maintaining a monitoring brief on genetically modified foods throughout the EU. Health promotion campaigns on nutrition and diet and the ability to initiate research into food allergy and food-borne disease could also come within its remit.
 I would argue that the list of possible functions is by no means exhaustive, and its accountability could also be ensured if it were required to produce an annual report and if its officers regularly appeared before the Parliament’s Environment, Public Health Consumer Policy and Committee.

What we have before us is a sensible compromise. What this means for the new Member States is a reduced need for cofinancing, which has rendered effective drawing of resources from the funds impossible. For example, this will mean a reduction of 15% for the Czech Republic. Private resources could become part of cofinancing. Non-recoverable value added tax will be an eligible cost and the absurd N+2 rule will at least for some time become N+3. Social housing projects that have a direct bearing on the environment will become an eligible cost for the funds. This sounds like the standard conditions that the original Members of the European Community made use of for decades. The ten new Member States, however, were denied them, perhaps in the hope that it would be possible to complicate even further the already difficult process of drawing EU resources, even though these resources formed part of the promise made in the accession conditions negotiations.
 Fortunately for the new Member States, it is not only Parliament that is unfairly divided into new and old Member States; this also applies to the Council, which has incorporated this compromise into the new rules. If, however, we leave the Council solely responsible for drawing up reasonable compromises, we will become a superfluous institution, which will simply take advantage of the voting rights of individual delegations to push through rules that will disintegrate the EU still further. The long and, here in Parliament, fruitless 14-month negotiation process has only served to demonstrate how matters in the EU would turn out if we adopted the European Constitution with a majority decision, indeed a decision that is valid here. The majority here in Parliament from the original Member States would impose rules on the weak, the small, the poor and the new. A decision-making process favouring consensus and veto, leading to reasonable compromises in the Council, would be removed from the equation.",0,Par405_Corporatism,2,[],,

 Yes, on that Friday morning ‘breakthrough’ was cried, and indeed Mr Van Rompuy parroted the word this morning: ‘breakthrough’. Nobody believes you. The wheels are coming off.
 This European Stability Mechanism, your new bailout vehicle, is doomed before it starts. We have legal challenges in Ireland and in Germany. We have the Estonian Justice Minister saying it will not fit their constitution but – most fun of all – the Finns and the Dutch seem to have broken the agreement that was made in the middle of the night. Perhaps they were excluded from this, perhaps the little countries do not have a say in Europe at all any more. It is not credible. The euro crisis now looks to me to be frankly insoluble.
 There is also a massive crisis of leadership. It is lovely to see you, Mr Van Rompuy. You have not been here for many months; it is delightful to have you back. Last time you were here, you told us we had turned the corner, that the worst of the crisis was over. With every one of your predictions, it goes on getting worse. I am sorry, sir: you do not have the presence, the credibility or the standing for the international markets to believe that you can provide a solution. And Mr Barroso here: at the G20, he stood up at the press conference and said that we do not need any lessons in democracy – said the unelected President of the European Commission. I mean, he went on to say that the eurozone’s problems had been caused by unorthodox practices in North America.
 You have made yourselves an international laughing stock. You do not have any credibility. But one piece of helpful advice from me: do not this summer go on any billionaires’ yachts on extended holidays, because the markets guarantee we will all be back here in August.",1,Par402_Incentives,2,"[""Free Market Economy""]",,

Mr Lannoye has done an excellent job; indeed, he has achieved what the Commission failed to. The Commission only offers talk of the precautionary principle, whereas Mr Lannoye has shown in his report that it is also about implementing it in practice and actually making the precautionary principle a keynote.
 I also fail to see what the Commission promised, i.e. transparency. It is nothing less than consumer deception if we are giving the illusion of freshness which does not in reality exist. Commissioner, you must finally come clean as to why you are not envisaging that unpacked foodstuffs, in particular fruit and vegetables, should also be compulsorily labelled.
 I would also like to once again stress what Mr Lannoye has said. This report makes clear that we need a reform of additives. We cannot place hundreds of additives on the market simply because industry wants it. It has nothing to do with competition that we reject what the Commission is proposing. We actually need, as in Japan, a limited list of 70-100 additives and I would have liked to know what the Commissioner thinks of this. Industry will then have to decide the ones it wants.

Blame e.g.Google for abuse of a dominant position.Very well, because there must be control.At the same time, however, bribery scandals and illegal activities of companies such as German Siemens and Volkswagen remain in the untouched.
In Greece for the past five years, the troika, by abolishing any concept of sovereign state, intervenes in the design of tax laws, resulting in increased tax evasion and tax fraud by ghost companies that carry out completely non-existent credit activities, enlargement of alertnessIn poverty and poverty, as well as the deterioration of the situation in immigration, economic policy, fundamental freedoms and competition.

Clearly, the free trade agreement with South Korea is close to being concluded. From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union.
 In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far. That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha? Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union’s free trade policy?
 As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry – in particular, in the car industry. This clause could lead to supporting business in low-cost countries such as India and China, thereby threatening European manufacturing. Can you see a way that these concerns on the part of a number of Member States in respect of such refunding of duties can still be addressed?",1,Par402_Incentives,2,[],,

From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union.
 In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far. That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha? Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union’s free trade policy?
 As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry – in particular, in the car industry.

Courtesy is not, however, the most common feature of this Parliament.
 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, one of your illustrious predecessors, Jacques Delors, said in a recent interview that the European Parliament would do better to deal with matters of concern to Europe’s citizens rather than focusing on human rights in Guatemala or on women’s rights in Equatorial Guinea. These are undoubtedly interesting matters but, at the moment, what Europeans are more concerned with – and something that the Brussels Summit, if I am not mistaken, is due to address – is the incredible growth deficit that is threatening to engulf the European economy and, within the European economy, those countries in particular that chose to put their fate in the hands of the euro and the European Central Bank. Whatever the criteria selected, be it debt, deficit, growth, unemployment, inflation – the three Member States that did not opt for the euro and which have kept their national currency are doing the best, including – see the Commission report on this matter – in the field of competition and the Lisbon strategy.

 The Commission welcomes the swift progress on this file and hopes that Parliament will adopt its first reading position tomorrow. We can all agree that consumers across the EU should be able to enforce their rights effectively in ‘mass harm’ situations, and that is why the Commission proposed this directive. Via the representative actions for the protection of the collective interest of consumers, qualified entities, such as consumer associations or independent public bodies, will be able to act. They will be able to stop infringements of consumer law and help obtain redress for those consumers who have been harmed. This will especially help vulnerable consumers in situations where they shy away from defending their rights individually.
 The proposal responds to the need for strong public and private enforcement of EU consumer rights. In line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the proposal gives Member States considerable room for manoeuvre on key procedural points. Our aim is to find solutions that safeguard consumer rights and ensure that traders are also treated fairly. From the beginning, we made it very clear that the Commission does not want to create a litigation culture in Europe, and the proposal on representative actions in no way lends itself to such an interpretation. We define a clearly European way of collective redress that is fair for consumers and businesses, that does not contain punitive damages, and is not bringing US—style class actions to the EU. In particular, we set strict standards for qualified entities which want to act on behalf of consumers.
 I welcome that the report is pursuing the same objective. In particular, I note the proposed strengthening of the criteria for qualified entities and the preservation of Member States’ discretion as to the precise procedural modalities. Member States share the objective of ensuring clear and effective rules for an efficient and proportionate collective redress system suitable for the European model.

Traditional development aid, which is taken more or less to be a sort of gift day in which the rich countries give to the poor ones, does not work. What we need is an all-embracing concept of the peaceful development of the poor countries. This is, of course, easier said than done, but we must remember that it is the countries with a wealth of raw materials, such as Angola or Nigeria, for example, whose people are the poorest. That is not by chance; there is a system behind it. We need to ask ourselves which, in this instance, are the donor countries and which the recipients – a question which, for me, has not been answered unambiguously.

 At this difficult time it is, above all, important for the European Central Bank, which is a young central bank, to gain credibility. For this reason we too will not be voting for three of the proposals made by the rapporteur in her report.
 The first proposal was that core inflation should be the key factor in economic decision making, that is to say inflation excluding energy and food. This would amount to looking at the world through rose-tinted spectacles, because what matters to the public is not core inflation but inflation including energy and food prices.
 The second proposal that we will be rejecting is that of setting inflation targets. I am convinced that the European Central Bank was right to establish its own definition of stability shortly after it was set up, according to which monetary stability is an inflation rate of less than 2%.

Matters subject to technical standards should be genuinely technical, and their development requires the expertise of supervisory experts.

 However, in connection with Parliament's view of last year I would urge Mr Duisenberg to reconsider a formal framework for the publication of summary minutes. As he said, much of the debate which happens within the Council is filtering out in the form of discussion within the monthly bulletin, but this is not the same as a regular report with a formal framework in which it is discussed. That would help anchor expectations within the market, as well as fulfilling the important accountability mandate of the ECB.

It is essential to point out that different growth trends exist within the different national components of the euro zone economy, and that this implies different sustainable wage growth rates over time. That is why it is important that there should be an overall discussion of what potential sustainable growth rates of wages are in each of the component parts of the euro zone economy, and why this will actually help deliver low inflation combined with low unemployment.

Our draft resolution on the G20 summit says that, firstly, various European Union countries have received support from the International Monetary Fund to resolve balance of payments problems and, secondly, that various countries in the euro zone have, thanks directly to the euro, been able to avoid exchange rate pressure in this situation. Unfortunately, however, the new European Union Member States cannot reduce this currency risk pressure, because they cannot join the euro zone. At the same time, the economy has become overheated in several new EU states as a direct result of the injection of a very large amount of money by many European banks, fighting to carve out a market in these states. Now it is borrowers who have been left to bear all the currency risk. I would therefore appeal for us to consider, particularly in the new EU Member States that have joined the exchange rate mechanism tool and keep to a fixed exchange rate that allows a large part of these loans to be paid back to European banks, whether this should not mean that these countries should also be helped with a swifter introduction of the euro. This is particularly crucial because solidarity is extremely important in difficult times.

Unfortunately, however, the new European Union Member States cannot reduce this currency risk pressure, because they cannot join the euro zone.

 The work programmes will encourage women’s participation in research and highlight the relevance of gender in specific topics. Large projects will have the possibility and will be encouraged to include gender equality actions in their projects, and these will be reimbursable actions, just like other activities in the projects.
 However, I would like to repeat that we should and we will give a positive example, but we are all aware that we cannot solve the problem without looking beyond the research portfolio. We are now facing difficulties that are part of a broader picture of reality in a society resulting in this unfavourable and unfair situation in which we are not using all of our knowledge potential. That is why I believe that the debate we will be having and which will specifically focus also on this issue is so crucially important.
 Concerning how we are trying to be practical, I can give you an example of how we address the question of evaluation panels, in which we have a target for 40% participation by women.

 If I thought it was going to cost 90 million jobs I would be against it too. In actual fact, it is the opposite. We are in favour of it because it is going to create jobs. It is going to create jobs in Europe, in Ireland, and that is what we want. The agreement with South Korea created 210 000 jobs, and yet the Canadian agreement is going to cost us jobs?

As a result of the negotiations and the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this document, though still too vague, has evolved significantly and is now trying to bring about real reform of the CAP. More particularly, maintaining the CAP budget after 2013 was an essential point. Indeed, we want to see the EU’s agricultural budget remain unchanged until 2020 to encourage farmers to guarantee the security of food supplies and the protection of the environment, to create new jobs, and to ensure a competitive agricultural sector. I then voted against the paragraph on payments to support genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and for the paragraph on the withdrawal of GMOs, and I supported the paragraph opposing the funding of the production of food from cloned animals and their offspring and descendants.

Have any fundamental changes been made in the area of human rights in China in the subsequent 16 years? None whatsoever. In fact, a huge portrait of Mao Tse-Tung, the biggest mass murderer of the 20th century, is still on display on Tiananmen Square.
 To this day, there are people in prison for being present at Tiananmen Square. Nor, in fact, are they the only political prisoners, for the so-called People’s Republic is still a Communist one-party state without any freedom of expression of opinion, freedom of the press or freedom of religion.
 Only the day before yesterday, for example, Bishop Jia Zhiguo, an underground Roman Catholic bishop in China, was arrested. He has already spent more than 20 years of his life in prison. Not only does the People’s Republic of China systematically and continually violate human rights, but it also forms a threat to regional stability and, by extension, to peace full stop. The so-called anti-secession law is like a knife held to Taiwan’s throat.
 The European Union is blowing hot and cold at the same time. On the one hand, it stresses that the human rights situation in China should improve, while on the other, it seeks to lift the arms embargo, thereby sending a message to the Chinese regime that it does not have to be too careful about human rights. Taiwan is given credit, and rightly, for its economic success and for real democracy, but it is not being spelled out to the People’s Republic that it is unacceptable to challenge Taiwan’s integrity. Under such circumstances, a strategic partnership with China should not be an end in itself, any more than the so-called One China Policy should remain an end in itself.

What is our experience?In the past period we have seen that they arrived too late to actually start at the start of 2014, 2015 and 2016.This had, for example, in a number of areas, such as cohesion policy and the second pillar agriculture, as a result that those expenditures only started very late.That must be better now.That must now be faster.This is also possible if the regulations are presented in one go, mid -2018.If we don't do that, then we get a repeat of what we have seen, namely that expenses are made very late in the period, in the 5 or 7 years.
We saw last time that a great pile of unpaid bills came.We are already seeing that 8 billion euros will return to the Member States in 2016.This year too, that will partly happen and we will get a great avalanche of accounts, soon in 2019 and 2020.

 We do not, of course, want to ignore the various initiatives planned by the Commission regarding employment and certain social issues, nor do we want to disregard the negotiation initiatives undertaken by the social partners.
 The fact is that, although the agenda has a programme structure, endorsed since Nice by the Lisbon conclusions, in particular – and which, moreover I clearly support – this initial assessment of its implementation would seem somewhat inconclusive, removed from the original plan and goals set. Indeed, I wonder whether, in the meantime, a predefined model and predefined frameworks exist, within which the responsibilities laid down by the agenda for the many parties involved can be exercised; whether there is evidence of even embryonic good quality work and what its particular characteristics are; whether the job placement systems and systems providing information on opportunities are successfully fulfilling their role and whether school and training courses are starting to be rationalised.
 Moreover, it should be ascertained, at both Community and national level, whether industrial relations are moving steadily towards general development in terms of flexibility and security and whether local bodies and social forces are starting to cooperate responsibly in respect of national action plans and whether these plans are starting to be fully consistent with Union guidelines.

 Unfortunately the European Parliament is opting in too many cases today to spend more money. That is why I have a problem with paragraphs 2 and 4 in the Virrankoski report. That is not appropriate in a European Union that wishes to concentrate on the areas where there is a benefit, the core tasks.
 Finally, an additional problem that makes it more difficult to approve the Virrankoski report is Amendment 2 by the Socialist Group.

However, we also need to put our own house in order. There would be no such imbalance with China, no such lack of consistency in the EU approach, if we had a common European position with regard to China. China has imposed multi-bilateral relations on Europe, and the burden of responsibility for having such an imbalance with China lies heavily with Member States.
 Of course, all Chinese products entering the European market must comply with internal standards. That is the law. Once the European Union is a genuine player in multilateral negotiations on achieving, in particular, binding social and environmental standards, and countries like China refuse to accept a framework of internationally binding standards, we believe that Europe is then entitled to impose standards regarding these equally international issues right at the entrance to the European market. These could include, for example, freedom of association. When this time comes, would Europe not be legitimate in deciding that all products entering the European market must come from countries that respect freedom of association? The protection of workers is a given fact here and this should also be the case in those countries.
 Then there is the issue that is key right now, namely, the issue of the photovoltaic industry. The European Union has always been at the forefront of renewable energy.

 This is a key point, a crucial moment for Europe. Do we, like the United States, protect our photovoltaic industry to support our goals for renewable energy or do we not?

 The first idea is that if we want to have a viable European Union which has good prospects for the future, we will inevitably have to improve economic and social cohesion policy. Eastern Europe must feel the same level of European solidarity experienced by countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland following their accession to the European Union. Improving cohesion policy is necessary, however, not only to counter the huge regional imbalances that will result from the entry of scores of least-favoured regions in the current candidate countries, but also to continue to deal with the backwardness that still exists in the current Europe of fifteen countries, particularly in the outermost regions. This is all the more important because eastwards enlargement will probably accentuate the lack of economic and social cohesion in the current Europe of Fifteen, in other words, regional asymmetries could increase within the current European Union as a result of the dynamics created by the enlargement process, particularly in the relationship between the outermost regions and the centre of Europe. In other words, countries such as Portugal could become further consigned to the edges of Europe and the current centre and could become even stronger because it will then be the centre of a Europe which is economically integrated from its western almost to its eastern borders.
 By this I wish to state that following 2006, we will need a cohesion policy which does not only look eastwards, but which also considers the still existing cohesion deficit in the current Europe of Fifteen and the new problems it will face as a result of enlargement.

 The first idea is that if we want to have a viable European Union which has good prospects for the future, we will inevitably have to improve economic and social cohesion policy. Eastern Europe must feel the same level of European solidarity experienced by countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland following their accession to the European Union. Improving cohesion policy is necessary, however, not only to counter the huge regional imbalances that will result from the entry of scores of least-favoured regions in the current candidate countries, but also to continue to deal with the backwardness that still exists in the current Europe of fifteen countries, particularly in the outermost regions. This is all the more important because eastwards enlargement will probably accentuate the lack of economic and social cohesion in the current Europe of Fifteen, in other words, regional asymmetries could increase within the current European Union as a result of the dynamics created by the enlargement process, particularly in the relationship between the outermost regions and the centre of Europe. In other words, countries such as Portugal could become further consigned to the edges of Europe and the current centre and could become even stronger because it will then be the centre of a Europe which is economically integrated from its western almost to its eastern borders.
 By this I wish to state that following 2006, we will need a cohesion policy which does not only look eastwards, but which also considers the still existing cohesion deficit in the current Europe of Fifteen and the new problems it will face as a result of enlargement.

 On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus.
 However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe’s cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years.",0,Par404_EconomicPlanning,2,"[""Technology and Infrastructure"",""Economic Planning""]",,

 So I believe that this proposed EU-China investment agreement has huge potential and we should grasp it.",1,Par404_EconomicPlanning,2,"[""Keynesian Demand Management""]",,

These are the priorities.
 We could add EUR 85 million to Horizon, bringing the total budget to almost EUR 12.9 billion – money that the scientific community so desperately needs. Health research is also included in the programme.
 EUR 60 million more in the Erasmus+ programme, bringing the total to around EUR 3.9 billion. This means more support for young people to travel and experience student life in another European country and city. I know this very well from the experience of Latvian students in particular, and it is by far one of the most successful programmes in the European Union. The current economic crisis makes this programme even more important, and I am glad that the European Union supports young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
 All in all, we could add EUR 670 million more to meet the needs and demands of Europeans.

The first is bad food, food which makes people ill. This is the most serious of the three and the solutions are good practice, hygiene, and, for when things go wrong, traceability. You must know the entire route from farm to table and be able to identify where and how the problem happened.
 The second is fake food. Food which does not make people ill but is not what it says. This is basically a matter of due diligence and contract law. In fact, commercial interests police this pretty well most of the time.
 The third is the consumer’s right to know what they are buying. Linked to this is nutritional science, which has to be based on science that does not date: for example, fat and sugar in the diet, which may be about to undergo a revolution as a result of our better understanding of the role of insulin in the body.

 It is true that Europe is not just about what is reasonable. Although it tries to be rational, it operates on the basis of symbols, too. It is not a unitary state, and we do not operate with only one capital in which all our institutions are based.

I am referring to the systematic industrialised murder of prisoners of conscience and the harvesting of their organs for transplants. What is going on in China now is comparable to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany in its enormity and horror. The victims of this persecution are prisoners of conscience. They are not dangerous political opponents of the regime; they are democracy activists and followers of peaceful religions and philosophies.
 A large proportion of these people are followers of Falun Gong, a traditional form of meditation that teaches truthfulness, compassion and tolerance. These virtues are, of course, completely intolerable to the Chinese Communist Party and threaten its very existence. Therefore, it has decided to exterminate these people while making a profit at the same time. What is going on in China would be unbelievable if it were not backed up by voluminous evidence gathered over a long period of time by impeccable sources. Falun Gong followers, Christians, democracy activists and others are arrested, sentenced for concocted crimes against the State and imprisoned. They are then murdered so that their organs can be used to supply the transplant industry. Unbelievably, some operations are done without anaesthetic, because this is apparently more effective for a successful transplant.
 Since the year 2000, an estimated 1 million to 1.5 million have been killed for their organs in enforced organ harvesting. These enforced transplants are now proceeding at an estimated 60 000 to 100 000 operations per year, and are worth in the region of USD 8 to 9 billion per year. The peoples of our countries must be made aware of this, and all diplomatic and economic pressure should be put on the Chinese Government to end this inhumane industry immediately.",1,Par404_EconomicPlanning,2,[],,

This project will only have a chance of success if we provide the necessary funding for it. Otherwise, this agenda will end up just like the one before it too, the Lisbon Strategy, wide of the mark in terms of achieving any of the objectives set. In this respect, I wish to share the sentiments of the rapporteur and emphasise how important the policies on young people, education, research and innovation are. In my view, they provide the cornerstones on which we will have to build both the 2011 budget and our vision for the future.",1,Par409_KeynesianDemandManagement,2,"[""Economic Goals""]",,
