Our dialogue with China – in which I have taken part myself – is very open and direct.\n The issue you raised is, of course, being pursued not only in relation to China, but also to Turkey. We have raised our concerns on the matter in our discussions with Turkey and will obviously continue to insist in future that the legal and administrative measures being established by Turkey in this respect are in line with our expectations in this domain, which of course correspond to international standards.",

This will have an immediate effect and we will definitely see the initial results in the following months.\n The European Commission is supporting Member States’ economies based on four major priorities, the most important of these being increasing the pre-financing from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund and increasing the support from the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund.

         "Madam President, Commissioner Prodi, Commissioner Byrne, the BSE and dioxin crises coupled with the ongoing controversy regarding genetically modified foods have combined to seriously undermine consumer confidence in the safety of food. Furthermore, inept handling of these issues by the respective governments and the EU itself has seriously undermined public confidence in the ability of politicians to deal with crises in the food chain.\n For these reasons, I welcome both Commissioner Byrne’s commitment to make food safety his number one priority and also the statement by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, in this House on 23 July, when he said that one of the first tasks of his Commission would be to restore consumer confidence in the safety of food products. Hence this debate. Commissioner Byrne, I may add, is to be commended for his prompt action in agreeing to produce a White Paper on EU food law later this year and also to tighten up the EU’s rapid alert system for food emergencies.\n However, I would urge the Commissioner to go the extra mile: if he and his colleagues are determined to regain the confidence of consumers and the food industry in the EU’s food safety structures, then he should establish a European food agency along similar lines to the US Food and Drug Administration. Such a body could take responsibility for the Commission’s present inspection and enforcement functions in relation to the food hygiene, veterinary and plant health legislation. It could also have responsibility for the rapid alert system itself. It could be given the role for the authorisation process for GMOs and genetically modified foods while also maintaining a monitoring brief on genetically modified foods throughout the EU. Health promotion campaigns on nutrition and diet and the ability to initiate research into food allergy and food-borne disease could also come within its remit.\n I would argue that the list of possible functions is by no means exhaustive, and its accountability could also be ensured if it were required to produce an annual report and if its officers regularly appeared before the Parliament’s Environment, Public Health Consumer Policy and Committee.\n I would urge you, Commissioner Byrne, to give serious consideration to the establishment of an independent food agency along these lines. Such an initiative would, in my view, restore not only consumer confidence in food but also public confidence in the EU itself.",

         "Mr President, today’s debate sees the end of a 14—month-plus process of negotiation on general rules on drawing resources from the funds. What we have before us is a sensible compromise. What this means for the new Member States is a reduced need for cofinancing, which has rendered effective drawing of resources from the funds impossible. For example, this will mean a reduction of 15% for the Czech Republic. Private resources could become part of cofinancing. Non-recoverable value added tax will be an eligible cost and the absurd N+2 rule will at least for some time become N+3. Social housing projects that have a direct bearing on the environment will become an eligible cost for the funds. This sounds like the standard conditions that the original Members of the European Community made use of for decades. The ten new Member States, however, were denied them, perhaps in the hope that it would be possible to complicate even further the already difficult process of drawing EU resources, even though these resources formed part of the promise made in the accession conditions negotiations.\n Fortunately for the new Member States, it is not only Parliament that is unfairly divided into new and old Member States; this also applies to the Council, which has incorporated this compromise into the new rules. If, however, we leave the Council solely responsible for drawing up reasonable compromises, we will become a superfluous institution, which will simply take advantage of the voting rights of individual delegations to push through rules that will disintegrate the EU still further. The long and, here in Parliament, fruitless 14-month negotiation process has only served to demonstrate how matters in the EU would turn out if we adopted the European Constitution with a majority decision, indeed a decision that is valid here. The majority here in Parliament from the original Member States would impose rules on the weak, the small, the poor and the new. A decision-making process favouring consensus and veto, leading to reasonable compromises in the Council, would be removed from the equation.",

         "Mr President, today’s debate sees the end of a 14—month-plus process of negotiation on general rules on drawing resources from the funds. What we have before us is a sensible compromise. What this means for the new Member States is a reduced need for cofinancing, which has rendered effective drawing of resources from the funds impossible. For example, this will mean a reduction of 15% for the Czech Republic. Private resources could become part of cofinancing. Non-recoverable value added tax will be an eligible cost and the absurd N+2 rule will at least for some time become N+3. Social housing projects that have a direct bearing on the environment will become an eligible cost for the funds. This sounds like the standard conditions that the original Members of the European Community made use of for decades. The ten new Member States, however, were denied them, perhaps in the hope that it would be possible to complicate even further the already difficult process of drawing EU resources, even though these resources formed part of the promise made in the accession conditions negotiations.\n Fortunately for the new Member States, it is not only Parliament that is unfairly divided into new and old Member States; this also applies to the Council, which has incorporated this compromise into the new rules.
